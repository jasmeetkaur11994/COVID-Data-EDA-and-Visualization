# Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Data
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on COVID-19 data to gain insights into the spread of the pandemic, identify the most affected regions, and analyze the effectiveness of interventions and control measures. The data was collected from reliable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO).

#### Getting Started
1. To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:
2. Clone the repository
3. Copy code: git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
4. Install the required libraries
5. Run the Jupyter Notebook

#### Prerequisites
The project requires the following libraries to be installed:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. plotly


#### Data Source
The data was collected from reliable sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and is available in the data folder.

#### Data Cleaning and Manipulation
The data was cleaned and manipulated using Python's pandas library to prepare it for analysis. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating new columns for analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to gain insights into the spread of the pandemic, identify the most affected regions, and analyze the effectiveness of interventions and control measures. This involved creating visualizations and performing statistical analysis.

1. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed to test hypotheses and determine the significance of relationships between variables.

2. Data Visualization
Data visualization was used to effectively communicate the findings of the analysis. This involved creating various charts, graphs, and dashboards using Tableau.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights into the spread of COVID-19, identifying the most affected regions, and analyzing the effectiveness of interventions and control measures. The project demonstrates the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex phenomena such as pandemics.
